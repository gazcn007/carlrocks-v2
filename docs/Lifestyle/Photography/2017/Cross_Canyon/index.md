# A Life Goal Achieved

Grand Canyon is usually what comes to my mind when I think of Western USA. I have seen it only in movie and game material, but never really experienced it. After TC17, a friend of mine at Tableau, An, asked me if I wanna do a rim to rim crossing of Grand Canyon, I gladly accepted the offering :) My other friend Fez was really interested in the hiking too; so he flew all the way from Seattle to Las Vegas to join us.

# Route Plan

We were originally gonna do a rim-to-rim hiking. However since its October already, North Rim was closed due to the weather condition.

Original Plan:

# Hazard!

We arrived at a motel in Grand Canyon National Park a day in advance; and we started the hiking challenge officially at 5 am, Oct 14th.

I took this photo when we were almost half way through on our way back, but yea, the National Park firmly said that it is a hazard if you want to hike down to the colorado river and come back in a day:

The canyon is very dangerous, there are some cases where if you miss a step, you will fall off the canyon and die:
