# Las Vegas

It was not the first time for me to be in Vegas, but this was one of special time for me to be in Vegas.
Well, first, it was the first time for me to fly on a business trip to Vegas; but, sadly, 4 days before my arrival, Vegas experienced the worst mass shooting in the modern american history.

You can still see the windows of the shooter's rooms were not replaced by the day I arrived.

The city was a little bit calmer than usual after the tragedy:

Also, a great aspect of Tableau Culture. I crashed into our CEO, Adam Selipsky, outside of Mandalay Bay. He was really chill, any employee could shake hands and talk to him:

# Takeaway

So yea, it was a great experience at TC17 after all. 

The major takeaways are:

- Tableau is very popular in BI industry:

	I have basically met every single Amerian company I know from all backgrounds:
	- Finance: JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, UBS, Wells Fargo...
	- Entertainments: Blizzards, Warner Bros, Disney, Casinos, EA...
	- Airlines: United, Delta, AA, Boeing...
	- Tech: Apple ( a lot of ppl, some of them have been coming for > 5 years ), Amazon, MS, Google, Facebook, Pinterest, Zillow...
	- Schools: Stanford, MIT, Yale, UChicago, UBC, UT Austin...

- Tableau is getting more popular:
	- If you look at sponsors of Tableau Conference, in 2014, there were rarely big tech companies. In TC17, almost all tech giants have their panels, incl. Facebook, Cloudera, Google...
	- SAP used to blacklist Tableau within the company, they even had a prescence at TC17 as well, a large number of them as well.

- Big Data Culture is increasing
	-  As I have talked to a few pepole at TC17. Some of smaller businesses are also transformming from traditional text/excel to databases and Tableau to become more data driven.
	-  One of the Lady I talked to works at a public high school. She has been coming to TC for 5 years. She said, even in some suburb areas, Tableau is getting popular, and there are schools that even use Tableau to analyze students' performance, which is pretty awesome.
