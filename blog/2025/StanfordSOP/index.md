:::info context
Recently accepted to Stanford's M.S. in Learning Design and Technology 🎉, having developed educational technology projects and ventures (see my [GitHub](https://github.com/gazcn007)), this program represents a perfect opportunity to advance my work! I'm sharing insights from my application journey. 

Stanford's graduate programs are highly selective, often accepting only 20 students per cohort. This essay will be a summary guide for how to approach a grad school application at Stanford, and provide some tips on writing a clear and concise SOP.

**Note:** This guide focuses on Stanford Master of Science applications, though requirements vary for MBA, Medicine, Law, and PhD programs.

Below, I'll outline crucial components of successful Stanford applications, emphasizing the Statement of Purpose—typically the most challenging and important element.

# How to Prepare

For master's program admissions, the importance of different components varies by school and program, but generally, the Statement of Purpose (SOP) and Letters of Recommendation (LORs) play the most significant roles. Work experience, GPA, and test scores are less important and are substitutable.

# How to organize

I consulted with graduates and those familiar with the admissions process to understand what truly matters for a master's application. Here are my key takeaways:

- **Clear Purpose** - Unlike undergraduate applications, graduate school applications require a well-defined purpose. You need to clearly articulate your research interests and explain why this master's program is essential for your career growth. Show how it aligns with your goals and how Stanford's resources will help you achieve them.
- **Show Your Trajectory** - Highlighting your future potential is crucial. A strong recommendation from a tech executive can demonstrate your network and credibility. An upward trend in your GPA or a successful career despite initial academic challenges showcases resilience and growth.
- **Entrepreneurial mindset** — It's Stanford, they want the next generation of visionaries, whether it's a future Sam Altman, Larry Page, Jensen Huang, or Morris Chang. They seek interdisciplinary individuals who will contribute new ideas to their intellectual community.
- **Yield matters** — with a small cohort, they prioritize applicants who demonstrate genuine passion and a strong likelihood of accepting the offer.


How I approached this is similar to how I would write a business plan and do an investor's pitch, I put all my materials to support my purpose.

| **Aspect**       | **Maps to**                                         | **Description**                                      | **Supporting Material**                             |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **What**         | Clear Purpose                                      | What is my purpose of doing this master's program?   | Statement of Purpose  |
| **Why**          | Show Your Trajectory                               | Why Stanford, Why Me?                                | Statement of Purpose, Recommendation letters, Resume, Project links, Presentations, Awards   |
| **How**          | Entrepreneurial mindset                            | How will I achieve my purpose? What do I bring to the table? | Statement of Purpose and short answers to applciation questions               |
| **Conclusion**   | Yield matters                                      | Upon getting accepted, I will...                     | Statement of Purpose       |

The Statement of Purpose is the most crucial component and the only aspect for which you have a certain amount of freedom upon submission.

# How to Write a Good SOP
- **Statement of Purpose is a statement of Purpose not Past (Important❗)**
  - A lot of people got this wrong, they write too much about their past experiences and how they are a good fit for the program. **You must focus on the purpose, and purpose only.**
- **Less is more**
  - Although SOPs may reach 1000 words, strive for a length of 600-800 words. Focus on concise and targeted writing rather than attempting to fill the maximum word count with excessive information.
  - Be clear and focused; your SOP should center around a single, well-defined purpose. Avoid straying from this main point.

:::tip
>"Shorter Answers, you know the United States" -- Mike Wallace

<div style={{ position: 'relative', paddingTop: '56.25%' }}>
  <ReactPlayer
    url={require('./wallace.mp4').default}
    controls
    width="100%"
    height="100%"
    style={{ position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0 }}
  />
</div>
:::

- **Tell a cohesive story**
  - Ensure your SOP aligns with your resume, LORs, and other materials to form a unified narrative. For instance, if you highlight the impact of a past experience, one of your LORs should reinforce that point.
  - Start with a compelling hook; think of it as a one-minute elevator pitch about yourself.

- **Discuss the University**
  - Highlight specific courses and faculty that inspire you, demonstrating thorough research.
  - Articulate your unique contributions to the cohort and program.
  - Identify one or two distinctive aspects of Stanford that excite you, showcasing your genuine interest and individuality as an applicant.


### Common SOP Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ **Writing a biography** instead of a purpose statement
- ❌ **Generic statements** that could apply to any school
- ❌ **Focusing solely on achievements** without connecting to future goals
- ❌ **Overemphasizing undergraduate challenges** or explanations for poor grades
- ❌ **Name-dropping** faculty without substantive connection to their work
- ❌ **Vague research interests** ("I'm interested in AI")
