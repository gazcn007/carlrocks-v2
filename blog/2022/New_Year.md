# New Year Thoughts

## Definition of Goals
- Subjective vs Objective
- Goals can be gamed by blurring its measure of success:
   - ❌Wrong: I made a good product because I think people will like it
   - ✔️Correct: 
      - Physical Fact: Humans landed on the moon
      - Economic Fact: People like to pay millions of dollars for a software license per year


## First Principal thinking
- Get to the fundamentals than learning the buzz words
   - ❌Wrong: Learning definitions of Cloud, SaaS, PaaS, Metaverse...
   - ✔️Correct: Understanding FSM "finite state machine", Turning Completeness, Gödel's incomplete theorem... (This is why getting a degree in Business is so less valuable than getting a degree in Engineering. If I give you a book that has the same business strategy as Airbnb, you probably won't build another Airbnb; Whereas, if I give you a snippet of code, whether its 0 or 1, you can justify it in hours)

## Information Hygiene
- Quality of information is important
- Focus on original, non-translated, academical textbooks than reading short fragmented articles online
- Focus on picking the atomic information
