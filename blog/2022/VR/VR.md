## Immersive Systems and Sensorimotor Contingencies (SC)
- Immersive systems can be characterized by the sensorimotor contingencies (SC) that they support
- SCs refer to the actions necessary for perception of the virtual world
- Any immersive system will have a set of SCs that enable perception of the virtual world within that system

## Place Illusion (PI)
- The illusion of being in the virtual place even though you know for sure that you are not there.

### PI can break
- Latency:
    - Doesn't achieve 15 Frames/Sec
- Feel something that should not be there:
    - Device Issue: Weight of helmet, cables, controllers
    - Body movement in a room breaks PI, colliding with a furniture or a wall
- Resolution Details
    - when looking at something closer than resolution permits

## Plausibility (Psi)
- The illusion that situations and events are what they appear to represent. 

### Psi can break
- Incongruence of events/appearances with expectation
- Lack of correlation with own actions
- Lack of consistency in cause effect relationships

## Qualia
- To see (PI) and to know (Psi)
- Stop at a traffic light automatically without consciously being aware of seeing the redness of the light
